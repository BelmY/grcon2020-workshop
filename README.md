# GRCon20 workshop: Decoding interplanetary spacecraft

This repository contains material for the workshop "Decoding interplanetary
spacecraft" by Daniel Est√©vez at [GRCon20](https://www.gnuradio.org/grcon/grcon20/)
on 14 September 2020. The material
supplied here will be useful to attendees of the workshop who want to follow
along using their own computers, and for reference after the workshop.

The work is centred around building GNU Radio flowgraphs to analyze and
demodulate deep-space probes IQ recordings.

This repository contains a number of GNU Radio companion `.grc` files called
`handson_*.grc` that show the progress at different steps during the hands-on
part of the workshop with GNU Radio companion.

It also contains the PDF slides for the workshop in the folder `slides/`.

## Requirements

The flowgraphs created in the workshop need the following:

* [GNU Radio 3.8](https://www.gnuradio.org/)
* [gr-satellites](https://github.com/daniestevez/gr-satellites) (any version
  since v3.0.0 is fine)
* [gr-dslwp](https://github.com/daniestevez/gr-dslwp/tree/maint38), branch
  `maint38`

There is also a very brief part of the workshop that uses a Jupyter
notebook. This needs:

* [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)
* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [construct](https://construct.readthedocs.io/)

If someone faces problems installing any of the above, I'm welcome to help in
the issues of this repository. Also, note the following:

gr-satellites will only be used for the AGC, so instead of
installing gr-satellites, it is also possible to download and generate the
[AGC hierarchical
flowgraph](https://github.com/daniestevez/gr-satellites/blob/master/python/hier/rms_agc.grc).

gr-dslwp will only be used for Turbo decoding in the last part of the
workshop. Most of the workshop can be followed without gr-dslwp.

It is possible to test that GNU Radio and the OOT modules are working correctly
by using the `handson_09_turbo_decode.grc` flowgraph. Jupyter and related python
packages can be tested with the `Frames.ipynb` notebook.

## Recordings

The IQ recordings that will be used in this workshop can be downloaded
[here](http://eala.destevez.net/~daniel/grcon2020-workshop/). They should be
placed in the `recordings/` folder inside this repository. Thes files total to nearly
1GB, so attendees are recommended to download these before the workshop.

## GNU Radio Logging

If you have a freshly installed GNU Radio or are using a Virtual Machine with
GNU Radio, then the default logging configuration will produce many debug
messages with some of the flowgraphs. These messages can make
`gnuradio-companion` run very slowly. It is recommended that you edit (or
create) `~/.gnuradio/config.conf` and enter into this file:

```
[log]
log_level = info
```

to reduce the number of debug messages.
